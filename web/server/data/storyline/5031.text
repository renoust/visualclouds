"Set along Chicago's Little Village neighborhood, 'On The Downlow' is a new feature based on Chicago filmmaker Tadeo Garcia's award-winning short 'Broken Warning'. 'On The Downlow' is the explosive story of the relationship between Isaac and Angel, two young Latinos involved in a Southside Chicago gang. The decisions these men make and the paths they each take create a trap for them in a community where rules can't be broken and secrets won't be tolerated. With characters that defy stereotyping and a surprising tenderness, On The Downlow is an unconventional look at life in the hood."
