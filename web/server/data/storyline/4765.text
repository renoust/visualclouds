"A documentary focusing on the tumultuous early days of this iconic vaudeville superstar who ruled the 1920's Flapper Era in the U.S. Before Mae West, Marilyn Monroe, Bette Midler, Madonna and Lady Gaga, Tucker was the first woman to infatuate her audiences with a bold, bawdy and brassy style unlike any other previous performer. Using all of \"The Last of the Red Hot Mamas\" 400+ recently rediscovered personal scrapbooks, authors Susan and Lloyd Ecker take you on their seven year journey retracing Tucker's 60 year show business career."
