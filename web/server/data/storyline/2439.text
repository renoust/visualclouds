"When the young Texas Ranger, John Reid, is the sole survivor of an ambush arranged by the outlaw leader, Butch Cavendish, he is rescued by an old childhood Comanche friend, Tonto. When he recovers from his wounds, he dedicates his life to fighting the crime that Cavendish represents. To this end, John Reid disguises himself and becomes the great masked western hero, The Lone Ranger. With the help of Tonto, the pair go to rescue President Ulysses S. Grant when Cavendish takes him hostage. We learn that Cavendish was an officer in the United States military before he was court marshaled and dishonorably discharged."
