While she is working in the wedding preparations she meets Luce, wedding's florist, unexpectedly falling in love to her and discovering what is having love feeling to another woman. Unable to stop her Rachel meets Luce a few times hiding it to her family, specially her mother Tessa because she contracted Luce.
