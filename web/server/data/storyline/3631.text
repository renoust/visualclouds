"It's 1913, and the \"traditional\" American West is dying. Among the inhabitants of this dying era are an outlaw gang called \"The Wild Bunch.\" After a failed railroad office robbery, the gang heads to Mexico to do one last job. Seeing their times and lives drifting away in the newly formed world of the 20th century, the gang takes the job and ends up in a brutally violent last stand against their enemies deemed to be corrupt, in a small Mexican town ruled by a ruthless general."
