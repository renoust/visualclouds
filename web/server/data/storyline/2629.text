"A take on the classic tale \"The Boy Who Cried Wolf\", this is the story of a 14-year-old boy named Jason Shephard who lies for the fun of it. He leaves an important story assignment entitled \"Big Fat Liar\" in movie producer Marty Wolf's limo, which Marty then turns into a film. When Jason sees a movie preview of his story, he and his best friend, Kaylee, travel to Los Angeles to make Marty confess to using his story, to clear his name, and to get him out of having to attend summer school. Jason then has to match wits with Marty, who also turns out to be a big liar."
