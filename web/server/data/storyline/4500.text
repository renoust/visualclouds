She is financially stable but has to live with the guilt of having left her daughter J\u00e9ssica, in Pernambuco, in the northeast of Brazil, raised by relatives. As college entrance exams roll around, J\u00e9ssica wants to come to S\u00e3o Paulo to take her college entrance exams too. When J\u00e9ssica arrives, cohabitation is not easy. Everyone will be affected by the personality and candor of the girl and Val finds herself right in the middle of it."
