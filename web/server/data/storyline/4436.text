"Diane's free-wheeling life of drunken one-night-stands as a professional trucker hits a road block when Peter, her son, is dropped at her doorstep. Her former husband Len, whom she abandoned eleven years ago along with their new-born son, has cancer and no one else to turn to while he's in the hospital. Peter, resentful and wary, wants, even needs a mother who'll want him at this worrisome time but knows better than to expect this from Diane. With deliveries waiting and a mortgage to be paid, there's only one inevitable thing ahead for Diane and Peter - a road trip together."
