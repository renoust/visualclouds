"The year is 2008. Global warming has melted much of the polar ice caps, resulting in serious flooding around the world - including the city of London, which is now under several feet of water. In the ensuing chaos, law and order has broken down and a new killer has emerged. One that's unnatural, unrelenting and unstoppable. Maverick veteran policeman Harley Stone has a link with the killer - it murdered his partner and he will do whatever it takes to bring down the killer. As a new rookie is assigned to him, Stone must find the killer, rescue his girlfriend and fight off his own inner demons as he gets closer to his mysterious adversary. But when the killer is a vicious 10 foot tall alien creature, even in the future, there aren't guns big enough to stop the creature's deadly reign."
