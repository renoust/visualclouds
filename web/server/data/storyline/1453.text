"Smart-but-ineffectual journalist Dan \"We use euphemisms!\" cannot decide between his girlfriend, loving-but-clingy waitress Alice, or his lover cold-but-intellectual photographer Anna; herself indecisive between Dan and honest-but-thuggish \"You're bloody gorgeous!\" doctor Larry. The film puts the four leading characters in a box and strips them apart."
