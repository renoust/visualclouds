"Rei is a young inventor living in the U.K. in the middle of the nineteenth century. Shortly before the first World Expo, a marvelous invention called the \"Steam Ball\", behind which a menacing power is hidden, arrives at his door from his grandfather Roid in the U.S. Meanwhile, the nefarious O'Hara Foundation has sent men to acquire the Steam Ball, so that they can use its power towards their own illicit ends."
