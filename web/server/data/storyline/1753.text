"Florence Foster Jenkins, an heiress from NYC, always wanted to be a concert pianist and play Carnegie Hall. An injury in her youth deterred that dream, so she sets out to sing her way to Carnegie Hall, knowing the only way to get there would be, \"Practice, practice, practice\". Her husband supports her venture, and Florence Foster Jenkins' performance at Carnegie Hall becomes a truly historic event."
