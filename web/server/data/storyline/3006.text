"An Hungarian youth comes of age at Buchenwald during World War II. Gy\u00f6rgy K\u00f6ves is 14, the son of a merchant who's sent to a forced labor camp. After his father's departure, Gy\u00f6rgy gets a job at a brickyard; his bus is stopped and its Jewish occupants sent to camps. There, Gy\u00f6rgy find camaraderie, suffering, cruelty, illness, and death. He hears advice on preserving one's dignity and self-esteem. He discovers hatred. If he does survive and returns to Budapest, what will he find? What is natural; what is it to be a Jew? Sepia, black and white, and color alternate to shade the mood."
