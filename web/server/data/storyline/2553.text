"In the New Mexico desert, scientist, Vera Ivanov (Shantel VanSanten) watches in as a mysterious object falls to Earth. It explodes, and sends out a shockwave which briefly stops her heart. But Vera isn't the only one affected: she's instantly connected to 4 others, all of whom had also collapsed, only to come back to life hours later. A mysterious figure - known only as \"the man\" (Diogo Morgado) comes and offers Vera the chance to be reunited with her kidnapped son, if she helps him with one complicated task. Now, this group might be the only hope for preventing the impending end of civilisation... or causing it."
