"Detective Mark Hoffman is deemed a hero after he saves a young girl and \"escapes\" one of Jigsaw's games, or so it seems. Special Agent Peter Strahm is suspicious of him after his assistant Agent Lindsay Perez says Hoffman's name. While Agent Strahm looks into Detective Hoffman's past, a group of five people who helped burn down a building which was supposedly abandoned face a series of tests set up by Jigsaw."
