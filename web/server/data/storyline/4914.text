"They're in their 20s. He works in a video store; he's eager, chatty, sleeps in his car. She rents adult films, looks disheveled, rarely speaks. He chats her up, she brushes him off. He takes her address from store records and contrives to run into her. He rings her doorbell; she tells him to go away. He invents a story of a great-aunt who lives in the building and fakes her death to get the girl to let him in her apartment but holds a butcher knife between them. So it goes and he is no longer living in his car. He presses for a relationship; she ignores him, insults him, or yells. He's persistent, inviting her to get out of the apartment, cooking, washing her hair. Both have demons and, as their stories become more clear, his addictive personality and her sex nausea may be on a collision course."
