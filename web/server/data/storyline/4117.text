"Holly has everything it takes to be a star; the voice, the dream and the dedication, but she lacks the means to break away from her humble Texas upbringing. Then she gets the chance to attend an art and music school on the East coast and her future suddenly looks bright. But the road to stardom is a bumpy one. She must compete with the snobby Angela for the star spot and that's the least of her troubles. Luckily, Holly has the support from her mother and her roommate Ditz who prove that being a star has nothing to do with fame and everything to do with faith, family, and friends. Before all the number one hits and the adoring fans, all she had was the dream. Inspired by the book A Mother's Gift by Britney & Lynne Spears...the story of the true meaning of being a star."
