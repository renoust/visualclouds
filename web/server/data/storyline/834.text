"Divorced former baseball player Charlie Goodson is now an anger management therapist. He has a teenage daughter with obsessive-compulsive disorder and he has a purely sexual relationship with his therapist and best-friend Dr. Kate Wales. But soon his ex-wife and daughter become his past family, as they are being replaced by what is a non-official but real and much more close of a family to him: his anger management group."
