"Set on a university campus, the story line unfolds over a several month period in which the \"Greeks\" (fraternities and sororities) prepare for the culminating event: the step show competition. Against this backdrop there are numerous subplots involving the meeting and maturation of a love relationship, a kidnapping, an avenging abused co-ed, fraternity initiation rites, step scenes, and the antics of students and faculty alike."
